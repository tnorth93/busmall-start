## Market Research Team Member Stories*
1. As a market research team member I want 3 products displayed simultaneously and not repeated immediately following an appearance so that the focus group participant has an untainted testing experience.
2. As a market research team member I want the focus group participant to have an intuitive interface to navigate so that there is no confusion on how to complete the test.
3. As a market research team member I want the number of clicks on each product displayed to the user immediately following the 25th pick so that the data collected is displayed in an easy to read list.
4. As a market research team member I want a click tracker to show how many times an image is clicked on per 25 rounds of voting so I may discern the popularity of said product.

## H2 *Developer Stories*
1. As a developer I want to make sure that the focus group participant is given no more than 25 click votes so the market research team is provided with clean, uniform data to make decisions with.
2. As a developer I want to make sure no images are repeated immediately following a group of 3 in which they were presented to make sure all selections are represented fairly.
3. As a developer I want to make sure that all images are given near equal space in the group of 3 images so that no focus group members are persuaded to vote for an image based on the amount of attention it grabs from size.
4. As a developer I want to create a constructor so that the 20 product images are cycled through from an array of the products as objects.
5. As a developer I want a chart to generate  following the completed survey that shows the results in a clear and visually appealing manner.
6. As a developer I want to create local storage functionality so that the results will be persistent through browser refreshes and extended testing sessions (leaving the work station and comign back later for example).

## *Focus Group Participant Stories*
